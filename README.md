  At the place i worked at we designed 3d models of all our products for a catalogue and put screenshots of those products and categorised them.When management wanted a list of all the products which there were more than 300 of, going through each folder and writing the names one by one seemed like a daunting task so i wrote this python code that makes a list of all the files in a folder that ends with the given image extension,in this case *.jpg
